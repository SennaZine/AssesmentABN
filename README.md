# Summary

This project is an iOs application that has been created in 2016 by me for sportive young ladies. This project was one of my assignments during the course at the App Academy. I choose to use this application, because I was curious how I would test my own application. The purpose is to write structured UI tests using the  XCUITest framework. 

# Screens
The app starts by guiding you through the tour screens displaying information about the app. When the tour screens are finished, the login screen is shown. When you login and submit, then the main screen is displayed. The app consists of 4 screens each displayed after clicking one of the 4 tabbar items.

# Test Cases
All the testcases are defined in an excel file (testcases.xls) on top level in this project.
